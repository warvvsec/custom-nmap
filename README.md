# Custom Nmap-Like Port Scanner

This is my first GitHub repository: a lightweight, Python-based port scanner inspired by Nmap.  
The goal of this project is to learn, practice, and demonstrate fundamental cybersecurity, networking, and programming concepts.

## Overview

This tool performs:
- Multithreaded TCP connect scanning  
- Custom port range scanning  
- Optional banner grabbing  
- Fast and simple usage with no external dependencies  

It is intentionally minimal and educational.  
This project will grow over time as I add new features and learn more about network security and software development.

## Legal Disclaimer

This tool is intended for:
- Educational purposes  
- Cybersecurity learning  
- Scanning systems you own or have explicit permission to test  

Unauthorized scanning of networks is illegal and strictly prohibited.  
The author is not responsible for misuse of this tool.

## Future Improvements

Planned enhancements include:
- UDP scanning  
- Service fingerprinting  
- Basic OS detection  
- HTML or JSON scan reports  
- CVE lookups  

This repository will evolve as I improve my skills.
